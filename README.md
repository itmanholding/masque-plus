# Masque-Plus

A simple Go launcher for `usque` that handles registration, configuration, and running a SOCKS proxy.  
Designed for **Cloudflare MASQUE protocol** usage.

Cross-platform: works on **Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android**. The binaries are automatically built via **GitHub Actions**.

## Features

- Automatically registers `usque` if config is missing or renewal is requested.
- Supports both **IPv4** and **IPv6** endpoints.
- Starts a local SOCKS proxy on a specified IP and port.
- Handles private key errors by re-registering automatically.
- Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your system architecture from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ircfspace/masque-plus/releases/latest).

Place the `usque` binary in the same folder as this launcher (`Masque-Plus.exe` for Windows, or `Masque-Plus` for Linux/macOS).

## Usage

```bash
./Masque-Plus --endpoint <IP> [--bind <IP:Port>] [--renew] [--connect-timeout <duration>] [--scan] [-4|-6]
```

### Flags

| Flag                | Description                                                                                      | Default          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `--bind`            | IP and port to bind the local SOCKS proxy. Format: `IP:Port`.                                    | `127.0.0.1:1080` |
| `--endpoint`        | **Required** unless `--scan` is used. The MASQUE server endpoint to connect. Supports IPv4/IPv6. | -                |
| `--scan`            | Auto-select an endpoint by scanning and randomly choosing a suitable IP (respecting `-4`/`-6`).  | `false`          |
| `-4`                | Force IPv4 endpoint selection (works with `--scan` or provided `--endpoint`).                    | -                |
| `-6`                | Force IPv6 endpoint selection (works with `--scan` or provided `--endpoint`).                    | -                |
| `--connect-timeout` | Connection timeout for reaching the endpoint. Accepts Go-style durations (e.g., `10s`, `1m`).    | `15s`            |
| `--renew`           | Force renewal of the configuration even if `config.json` already exists.                         | `false`          |

### Examples

```bash
# Connect to MASQUE server at 162.159.198.2:443 and start a SOCKS proxy on the default 127.0.0.1:1080
./Masque-Plus --endpoint 162.159.198.2:443

# Bind SOCKS proxy to a custom IP and port
./Masque-Plus --endpoint 162.159.198.2:443 --bind 127.0.0.1:8086

# Force configuration renewal
./Masque-Plus --endpoint 162.159.198.2:443 --renew

# Use scanner to auto-select an endpoint (random IP; honors -4/-6)
./Masque-Plus --scan

# Scanner with forced IPv4
./Masque-Plus --scan -4

# Scanner with forced IPv6
./Masque-Plus --scan -6

# Set a custom connection timeout
./Masque-Plus --endpoint 162.159.198.2:443 --connect-timeout 30s
```

## TODO

✅ Add an internal endpoint scanner to automatically search and suggest optimal MASQUE endpoints.<br />
⬜ Planning to add the `MasqueInMasque` method to get an IP from a different location.

## Notes

- Make sure the `usque` binary has execution permissions (`chmod +x usque` on Linux/macOS).
- Configurations are saved in `config.json` in the same folder.
- If a private key error occurs, the launcher will attempt to re-register `usque` automatically.
- If you run it the first time, you don't need to give all the commands, Endpoint...., for subsequent times. Enter the folder in CMD, as before, this time just run the "masque-plus.exe" execution file.

## For Developers

To build the binary locally (Windows example):

```bash
go build -o masque-plus.exe
```

## Credits

- This project uses [`usque`](https://github.com/Diniboy1123/usque) as the core MASQUE implementation.
- MASQUE protocol and Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 inspired the functionality.
- Development and code assistance were supported by ChatGPT.
